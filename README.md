# deep-convection-initiation_code
This repository highlights some of the algorithms I developed for my master's project on the sensitivity of deep convection initiation (DCI) to horizontal grid resolution

Background:
project motivation, objective, model setup, 

Moist convection is fundamental in regulating a variety of atmospheric phenomena ranging from global-scale circulations to precipitating cumulus clouds with sub-kilometre horizontal length scales. Numerical simlation of this process exhibits strong sensitivity to model grid resolution, primarily because turbulence and microphysical processes, which are integral to convective clouds, are inadequately resolved on model grids, leading to substantial errors and biases in DCI forecasts. The focus of this project is placed on addressing two important objectives: (i) to thoroughly evaluate the sensitivity of simulated deep-convection initiation over a mesoscale convergence to horizontal grid spacing and (ii) to physically interpret the cloud-layer and subcloud processes regulating this sensitivity.
